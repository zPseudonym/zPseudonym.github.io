Hi, I am Tobias — I work full-time as a Security Engineer for a global Fortune 500 company; I recently completed my Bachelor of Science degree in IT here in Germany. Prior to my current position, I finished a 2.5-year computer science program, specializing in IT security. During this program, I also collaborated with other IT teams to gain experience in networking, systems administration, and programming.

On my blog, you can find documentation on [projects]({{< ref "/projects" >}}) I have been working on during my free time or as part of my university classes. The main topic covered by these projects is also IT security — what a surprise, right?

Feel free to visit my [profiles]({{< ref "/" >}}) on other platforms (e.g. [GitHub](https://github.com/zPseudonym), [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/zPseudonym)) or get in contact with me either via [e-mail](mailto:zpseudonym@protonmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobias-heckener/).
